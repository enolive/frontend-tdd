# Did you know?

You can turn on a full-page accessibility tree in chromium based browsers

![Go to the Dev Tools -> Elements -> Accessibilty. Activate the option for the full-page accessibility tree. After a reload you should see an option to toggle between the default DOM view and the accessibility tree represented by a human icon in the right top corner.](/chrome-a11y-tree.png)

# How?

<v-clicks>

1. Test that fails
2. Implement to make it succeed
3. Clean up your mess
4. GOTO 1
5. Profit!

# TDD in Frontend

<v-clicks>

* Testing very similar to assistive technologies
* Tooling highly opinionated towards ARIA roles & attributes
* [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)

# Hypothesis

TDD drives the frontend towards basic accessibility!

# Testing Library

<v-clicks>

- test components as the user experiences them
- one of the most popular frontend (testing) libs [Source](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/#tier_list)
- available for most ui frameworks
- component testing in JSDOM
- inspiration for E2E testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

# Example

```tsx
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import App from './App'

describe('Todo App', () => {
    it('shows header', () => {
        render(<App/>)

        const header = screen.getByRole('heading', {level: 1})
        expect(header).toHaveTextContent('Todo App')
    })
})
```

- Read and Create
- React
- Mocked API via MSW

# Out of scope

<v-clicks>

- testable component architecture
- mocks vs [nullables](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables/testing-without-mocks)
- E2E Testing
- further A11y testing
- fancy CSS
